### Program Structure
`Main.java` prompts the user for a starting vertex and runs both the depth-first search algorithm and the breadth-first search algorithm on the graph contained in `Graph.java`. 

The program will output which search algorithm it is running, what node it is starting on, and then will display each node it finds as it goes through the algorithm. 

### Running
Run `Main.java` and answer the initial prompt for a vertex to start on. Only input integers to this prompt.
